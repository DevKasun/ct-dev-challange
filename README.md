# About application
When you goto the home page you can see posts get from jsonplaceholder API. Each post can view separate page with post description. There are a search bar for search post from all posts
In users page we can see all users with details. Each user profile got two links to view posts and photo albums each user owned. When goto the ablums first there only shows albums of user and when click one of albums then goes to photos page. There are just dummy images from jsonplaceholder.

Aplication setup by using webpack from scractch. I have my own setup on github(https://github.com/DevKasun/react-webpack). With that application development faster instead of using "create-react-app" cli tool.
